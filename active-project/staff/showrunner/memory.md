# showrunner memory — schema: schemas/showrunner-memory.schema.md

project:
  brief: "taylor hebert, post gold morning, in westeros king's landing before dance of dragons. theme should be 'road to hell is paved with good intentions' where taylor does bad things for a good reason which later turns out to be bad. one book long series"
  constraints:
    settings:
      - "currency: gold dragon / silver stag / copper penny + star"
      - "class: smallfolk / landed / lordly / royal / Faith / Maesters (Westerosi)"
      - "year: 122 AC, late Viserys-I reign, pre-Dance of Dragons"
      - "place: King's Landing — Flea Bottom anchor + Red Keep + Dragonpit + Great Sept + seven gates + three hills"
      - "canonicity: F&B-aligned (HOTD where F&B silent); AU-tolerant for Worm transit"
      - "magic: dormant on KL court layer; rumor-permitted; not narrator-confirmed"
      - "dragons: backgrounded with instrumental pressure; not on-stage scene partners"
    themes_as_bounds:
      - "spine: road to hell is paved with good intentions — instrumental moral causation"
      - "story-type: slow-prevention-tragedy (mirror-of-canon)"
      - "tonal: tragic / ironic-causal; smallfolk gallows humor permitted; no comic relief; no fairytale-stasis"
      - "protagonist register: cold-utilitarian; explicit moral ledger; affect suppressed not absent; theme never spoken on-page"
    hard_fences:
      - "Earth-Bet proper-noun fence: parahuman jargon dialogue-banned, inner-monologue-rare"
      - "POV: Taylor first-person only; non-Taylor chapters must be marked interludes"
      - "no titles authored on book or chapter (slugs only)"
      - "end-place is structural-bad — locus is 'both' (Taylor dead/expelled + [cost-bearer] smallfolk class-slot dies in Dance's opening Flea Bottom violence; specific identity TBD at /and-cast)"
      - "single-book length floor: 18 chapters, 3 scenes/chapter minimum (re-run OQ-9 to compress)"

    path:
      motivation: "Taylor came to Westeros atoning for Khepri — the mass override of human will she performed at Gold Morning — with no plan except to be useful, to heal, to do good without taking control."
      anchor: "[cost-bearer] — smallfolk class-slot (identity TBD at /and-cast); the un-priced relationship Taylor refuses to enter into the ledger; closing-image bearer of what the trades cost."
      escalation: "Otto Hightower identifies Taylor's pattern-reading + insect-residue intelligence capability and offers her a function — not a title, not a rank — calibrated information-delivery to the Greens in exchange for his quiet shielding of [protect-target] (court-tier class-slot, identity TBD at /and-cast). Taylor accepts because the alternative is the protected node falls, the war comes, and Flea Bottom burns. The atonement-prohibition collapses into the rebuilt-Khepri-architecture: she reads bodies, routes information, and moves people without their knowledge — for better reasons, more carefully."
      trade: "To sustain the function and keep [protect-target] alive, Taylor progressively feeds Otto intelligence that consolidates Green-faction control over Maegor's Holdfast, the Small Council, and the dynastic succession. The trades are accurate. The accuracy is the catastrophe."
      irony: "The trades work — [protect-target] is shielded, the apparatus holds, the war is delayed — and Taylor comes to despise the elite she is preserving. She watches Aegon's court through the insect-feed and develops cold, articulated contempt for the royal family and the Westerosi elite whose continuity her work guarantees. The contempt does not free her: she despises the system she is consolidating, and continues, because the only thing more expensive than the trades is letting [cost-bearer] burn. When the Dance ignites anyway and Flea Bottom is among the first wards to burn, the contempt is what remains — a clear ledger entry naming exactly whom she empowered, in exchange for whom, and what it cost. The atonement was the repetition; the recognition was contempt without refusal."
